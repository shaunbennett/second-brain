# second-brain
This repository is a large dump of information that I have learned from personal experience, books, videos, and more. You can think of it like a second brain - a place where I can deposit information and come back to it on a rainy day.

## Why do this?
This started as a project through the COVID-19 pandemic. I found myself spending more time learning, reading, and doing, but at the same time I was having a much harder time remembering what I did and learned. Spending all my time at home, days started bleeding into one another and I needed a new way to keep track of what I did and to remember the things that I have learned.

Heavily inspired by Kevin Peng's [Learn Something Every Day](https://github.com/kevintpeng/Learn-Something-Every-Day), this is my solution to the memory problem. I hope to maintain this repository for years to come, knowing that it will always be a good place to look back on to see not only what I accomplished, but to reference things I have learned but may have forgotten.

## Organization
This repository is built with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and as such it will be easiest to read and navigate through the Obsidian app. Since everything is markdown, you can still read on Github's website, just keep in mind that page links (seen with \[\[\]\]) will not properly link you.
