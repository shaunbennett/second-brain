# Kombucha
Kombucha is a fermented tea drink that can often be bought in grocery stores. I got hooked on the drink during my internship at Riot Games where we had kombucha on tap.

Kombucha is fermented using a Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast, or SCOBY. As a result, when kombucha that is not pasteurized is sold in stores, it needs to be kept refridgerated at all times or the fermentation process will continue, leading to the bottle exploding or the fermentation progressing to vinegar. This is probably partly the reason why kombucha is so expensive when you purchase it in grocery stores, it costs money to keep the bottles constantly refridgerated all the way to the consumer.

## Home Brewing
This year I decided to get into kombucha brewing myself, to save money on the expensive cost of kombucha, but also to experiment with how different teas/sugars/fruits can create different flavours.

To get started with home brewing, I decided to take the easy route and purchase a [kit from amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Kombucha-Home-Brew-Kit-Delicious/dp/B07GPZXX5G). This gives me a 1 gallon glass jar to brew the kombucha in, tea and sugar for my first batch, and the important "starter liquid" containing the initial SCOBY that will hopefully continue to grow into a healthy colony.

### Fermentation Phases
When brewing kombucha at home, we seperate the fermentation process into multiple steps. Although it is perfectly fine to stop after the first fermentation and drink the tea right away, I opted to go for a second fermentation. Some people even break the steps down further into three fermentation phases, but two seems like a good place to start.

#### The first fermentation (F1)
The first fermentation, often called F1, is where you introduce your starter liquid into some sweet tea and allow the bacteria and yeast to grow, consuming the sugars in the sweet tea. This process is done with an open air system, usually putting a cloth over top of the glass jar to allow air flow while keeping out dust and other particulate.

The first fermentation typically lasts about 7-14 days, and as time goes on you will notice your brew liquid turn from a dark brown tea-like colour to a much lighter brown/caramel. The pH level in the brew liquid will drop as this process goes on, eventually reaching the ideal kombucha range of 2.5-3.5.

#### The second fermentation (F2)
The second fermentation is where we will take our brew liquid from the first fermentation and funnel it into sealed bottles that are built to handle pressure. I use [these](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N1RL153/) 500ml ones. This phase also gives us an opportunity to flavour the kombucha, often by adding some fruits or herbs to the container. Fruits work especially well because it gives the yeast and bacteria some extra sugar to feed off of during this fermentation phase.

This fermentation lasts about 2-4 days and during this process the yeast inside of the brew liquid will continue to consume the sugar and produce carbon dioxide. Since this is a sealed system, pressure will build up in the bottle and our kombucha will start to naturally carbonate! You need to be careful here, because if you leave the 2F bottles out too long or aren't careful, these high pressure bottles of love can turn into bombs. Once the second fermentation is done, these bottles should be placed in the fridge to slow down the fermentation process. Now you are ready to open and enjoy!
